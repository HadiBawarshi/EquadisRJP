# EquadisRJP

## Overview

EquadisRJP is an advanced **Supplier and Retailer Management** system built with ASP.NET 8 and a modular Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture. It consists of two primary Web API services:
- **EquadisRJP.IdentityAuth**: A standalone identity authentication service using JWT.
- **EquadisRJP.Service**: A core API that handles business logic, connected to multiple DDD-based libraries.

The system supports complex supplier-retailer relationships, partnership tracking, commercial offer publishing, and access control‚Äîall with a focus on clean architecture and security best practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- SQL Server (local or remote)
- Visual Studio 2022 or any compatible IDE

## Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HadiBawarshi/EquadisRJP.git
cd EquadisRJP
```
### 2. Open the Solution

Open `EquadisRJP.sln` in Visual Studio 2022.

### 3. Database Setup

Choose one of the following:

#### Option A: Use SQL Script

- Navigate to the `Resources` folder.
- Use one of the provided `.sql` files:
  - **Schema only** ‚Äì Creates just the structure.
  - **Schema + Seed** ‚Äì Creates the structure and inserts sample data including an admin user.
- Create a database named `RjpDb`, then execute the chosen SQL script.

#### Option B: Use Backup File

- Use the `RjpDb.bak` file from the `Resources` folder to restore the full database using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

### 4. Configure Connection String

Open `appsettings.Development.json` and update the connection string if needed:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=.;Database=RjpDb;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
}
```
### 5. Running the Project

- Set `EquadisRJP.Service` as the startup project to launch the Swagger UI.
- **Recommended**: Use a launch profile that starts both `EquadisRJP.Service` and `EquadisRJP.IdentityAuth` to enable authentication and full API functionality(you will need role based tokens to access certain apis).
